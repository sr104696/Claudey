"""Web-search discovery (site: queries on ATS domains and aggregator sites).

Searches need a search engine, which this code doesn't have without a SerpAPI key, so Claude runs
them with its WebSearch tool during /refresh-jobs, replaying seeds/search_queries.csv, and imports
the hits with `python -m radar import-leads <file> --source websearch:...`. This module only
records the channel's counts for the run log.
